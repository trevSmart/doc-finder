## Critical Business Process Starting Points

### High-Volume Integrations (Require Enhanced Monitoring)

1. **Customer Interaction Management** (Items 1-2)
2. **Case Management** (Items 3-5)
3. **XOM Orchestration** (Item 28)
4. **Gestiona Account Sync** (Item 13)
5. **Notification Services** (Item 23)

### High-Impact Integrations (Business Critical)

1. **Order Management** (Items 10, 28)
2. **Field Service** (Items 6, 16-17)
3. **Customer Authorization** (Items 18-22)
4. **GDPR Compliance** (Items 33-34)
5. **SLA Monitoring** (Item 35)

### Integration Dependencies

- **XOM Dependencies**: Items 10, 28 must be coordinated
- **ITOOL Dependencies**: Items 6, 16, 17 share field service workflow
- **GAE Dependencies**: Items 18-22 form complete authorization lifecycle
- **Case Dependencies**: Items 3-5 handle different case scenarios
- **GMMS Dependencies**: Items 7-9 share workforce management context

## Monitoring and Documentation Gaps

### Critical Gaps (❌)

- **34 out of 35 integrations** lack proper monitoring
- **Zero** have integration tracing implemented
- **No** centralized integration dashboard exists
- **No** integration SLA monitoring in place
- **No** integration dependency mapping documented

### Existing Monitoring (✅)

- **1 integration** (XOM Orchestration) has event state tracking
- Exception logging framework exists
- Custom metadata configuration in place
- Test coverage for most integrations

## Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1 (Critical)

1. Implement CC_TrazaInt\_\_c custom object for integration tracing
2. Create integration monitoring dashboard
3. Add integration success/failure tracking to top 10 volume integrations

### Priority 2 (High)

1. Standardize retry patterns across all HTTP callouts
2. Implement circuit breaker pattern for external system failures
3. Create integration dependency mapping documentation

### Priority 3 (Medium)

1. Add integration response time monitoring
2. Create integration SLA definitions and monitoring
3. Implement integration capacity planning metrics
